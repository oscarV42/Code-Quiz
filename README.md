# Code-Quiz

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive code assessment
which includes mulitple-choice questions and a timer that determines the users score. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

This project helped me familiarize myself with WebAPIs and its usefulness in JavaScript code.
